  \caption[Tracked Output vs Ground Truth Artificial Sequence]{Tracked Output vs Ground Truth Artificial Sequence. The top panel shows position in terms of XYZ displacement and the bottom shows rotation in terms of geodesic. The location is generally tracked quite well, while the rotation is noisy due to the rotational symmetry of the two tracked objects (a bolt-angular and shaft).}

Results here are shown for an artificial sequence with depth and RGB noise added.}
